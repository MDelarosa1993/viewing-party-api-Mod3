1. Structure Your README
   Add a section in your README file specifically for API documentation. This could be titled "API Endpoints" or something similar.

2. List the Endpoints
   For each endpoint, include the following details:

HTTP Method: (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
Path: The URL for the endpoint.
Description: A brief explanation of what the endpoint does.
Headers: Information about any required headers (e.g., API key).
Query Parameters: If applicable, specify any query parameters.
Request Body: For POST or PATCH requests, provide example request body data.
Response: Describe the structure of the response and potential status codes.
